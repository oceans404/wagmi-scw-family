# wagmi-scw-family

This is a fork of [wagmi-scw](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/wagmi-scw) that adds minimal styling and components using [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/), [flowbite-react](https://flowbite-react.com/), and the [Family ConnectKit](https://docs.family.co/connectkit).

## wagmi-scw details

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-wagmi`](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi/tree/main/packages/create-wagmi) and updated for Smart Wallet.

NOTE: Most of the hooks here are a bit of a poor man's Wagmi :D Hopefully the Wevm team adds hooks for Viem experimental features.

To run:

1. install bun `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
2. install packages `bun i`
3. run next app `bun run dev`

To use:

1. click "Coinbase wallet" button
2. create a new wallet, or use an existing one
3. transact! Click "mint" and use your new smart wallet on Base Sepolia.
